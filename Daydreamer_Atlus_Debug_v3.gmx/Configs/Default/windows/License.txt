COMPUTER GAME EVALUATION LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Computer Game Evaluation License Agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into by and between Roland Womack, d/b/a RolandStudios (“Roland”), and the person or entity named below (“Evaluator”),

	Roland has developed a computer software game entitled “Daydreamer,” which is currently in a pre-production phase.  Evaluator desires to test and evaluate Daydreamer in its current pre-production state.  Roland licenses the pre-production version of Daydreamer to Evaluator to allow Evaluator to test the game, pursuant to the following terms:

License.  Roland hereby grants to Evaluator in accordance with the terms of this Agreement a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited term license to one copy of the computer software game product currently known as, and referred to herein, as “Daydreamer.”  This license is for the pre-production version of the game, whether referred to as an Alpha version, a Beta version, an evaluation version, or pre-production version.  This license is not for the final, production version of Daydreamer.  This license allows Daydreamer to be installed on and operated on not more than two desktop or notebook personal computers, both of which must be under the control of Evaluator.  Daydreamer shall not be installed on a local area network.  This license does not allow for concurrent use on multiple machines.  The license granted herein is for the final, machine-readable, object code of Daydreamer only, and not the source code.  The license granted herein does include the right to make any copies of the Daydreamer software for any purpose. The grant of rights hereunder is license only and not a sale or conveyance of Daydreamer, which remains the sole and exclusive property of Roland.  Roland retains and reserves all rights, including copyright rights and moral rights worldwide, in and to Daydreamer other than the limited license granted by this Agreement.  

Restrictions. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of the parties hereto and does not convey any rights or benefits to any third party.  Evaluator will not use, modify, duplicate, create, sell or transfer Daydreamer in any manner other than that permitted under this Agreement. The Evaluator shall not: (i) permit any parent, subsidiary, affiliated entity, or third party to use Daydreamer for any purpose; (ii) post Daydreamer on any website, forum, bulletin board, or other medium accessible to others; or (iii) make any commercial use of Daydreamer.  Evaluator may not sub-license the license granted herein.  Evaluator will not disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of, in whole or in part, any or all of Daydreamer. Evaluator will not attempt to create derivative works of Daydreamer.  Evaluator shall have no right to independently modify, alter, or in any way change any aspects of Daydreamer.

Graphics, Artwork, and Storyline.  Daydreamer, as licensed hereunder, contains graphics, artwork, and storyline elements (collectively “Elements”), which are included in the license of Daydreamer.  The term “Daydreamer” as used in this Agreement includes the Elements.  Evaluator obtains no rights in or to the Elements except as they are contained within and are a part of Daydreamer.  Evaluator will not attempt to copy, reproduce, or create derivative works of any of the Elements.  Evaluator may not post copies or facsimiles of any of the elements on any website, forum, or bulletin board.  Evaluator may not use scrapers, snag tools, or other print screen or screen capture functions to make copies or images of any of the Elements.  

Term and Termination.  The Term of this Agreement is for a commercially-reasonable period sufficient to permit Evaluator to test and evaluate Daydreamer.  In no event will the Term exceed six months from the Effective Date.  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason by providing the other party with written notice (which may be by email) of termination five business days in advance of the termination date.  
 
Evaluator’s Obligations. Evaluator agrees to make commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to employ best practices to test and evaluate Daydreamer and to provide Roland with constructive comments and feedback with respect to further development and improvement of the game.
